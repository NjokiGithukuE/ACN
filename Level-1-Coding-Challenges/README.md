Task 1.1
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Task 1.2
Write a function that takes 2 numbers as input. If either of the numbers is 3 and the sum of the numbers contains a 3 then return true. Otherwise, return false.

Task 1.3
Write a function that takes 2 numbers as input. If either of the numbers is 65, or if the sum of the numbers is 65 then return true. Otherwise, return false.

Task 1.4
Write a function, name it square. It takes in an integer and then prints out a square using the hash character.

For example, square(2) should print:

##
##
For example, square(4) should print:

####
####
####
####
Task 1.5
For example, triangle(2) should print:

#
##
For example, triangle(4) should print:

#
##
###
####
If negative numbers are input then the triangle should be upside down.

For example, triangle(-2) should print:

##
#
For example, triangle(-4) should print:

####
###
##
#
Task 1.6
Write a function that takes in an array/list of strings and then prints out the longest one.

For example, longest(["the","quick","brown", "fox", "ate", "my", "chickens"]) should print:

chickens
If there are multiple longest strings then print them all.

For example, longest(["once", "upon", "a", "time"]) should print:

once
upon
time
Task 1.7
Write a function that combines two lists by taking alternate elements and returns the result. You can assume the lists are of equal size.

If your function can work with lists of unequal size, we’ll think you’re cool.

For example, combine([11,22,33], [1,2,3]) should return:

[11,1,22,2,33,3]
