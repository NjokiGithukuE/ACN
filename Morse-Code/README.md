Create two functions:

lettersToMorseCode
morseCodeToLetters
eg:

lettersToMorseCode("Hi there")
// should return
// ".... .. / - .... . .-. ."
Make sure to cater for punctuation marks and all special characters.

Include the following assertions in your code:

Assert that the output and input both have the same number of characters represented.
Assert that there are the right number of spaces represented in the output.
Make sure that when you do this, your code remains clean and dry.


OPTIONAL CHALLENGE
Add unit tests to your code.
